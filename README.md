## About the dataset
This data contains the number of hires of London's Santander Cycle Hire Scheme from 2011 to present. Data includes start and stop timestamps, station names and ride duration.  The database contained two tables: 'cycle_hire' with 83,434,866 rows and 'cycle_stations' with 795 rows.
## Problem
The following problems have been identified in the current system:
- **Confusing price structure**: Users find it difficult to understand the pricing tiers or how charges are calculated.
- **Docking station availability**: Docking stations are either full or empty during peak hours
- **Maintenance problems**: Bicycles and stations are not consistently well-maintained, affecting usability and safety.
- **Unexpected charges**: Users report being charged without clear justification or prior notice.
- **Poor customer support**: Response times and issue resolution from customer service are inadequate.
